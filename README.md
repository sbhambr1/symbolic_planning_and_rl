# Solving Long-Horizon Multi-Step Tasks by Combining Planning and Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract:
While  planning  methods  are  robust  for  long  horizon  prob-lems in domains that can be easily and effectively expressedin a symbolic representation, these methods do not adapt wellto uncertainties in dynamic environments. Similarly, for tra-ditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) problems, thedata availability becomes a crucial bottleneck in solving com-plex problems. Furthermore, the black-box nature of DRL so-lutions affects the interpretability of the approach. The ideabehind hybrid approaches that combine both planning and re-inforcement learning is to leverage the benefits of both themethods for efficient and robust decision-making in complex,and often, evolving environments. In this project, we explorethis  concept,  formulate  aplanning+RLframework  for  twowidely used domains - Taxi and the Atari game: Montezuma’sRevenge, and report insights from our experiments.

### Note: Experimental results will be added soon.
